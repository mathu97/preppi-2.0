# Preppi
A mobile application that is intended to help you improve your public speaking skills

## Purpose: 
Want to help users practice their speeches/presentations without having to always rely on a friend to give them feedback. 

## MVP: 
An application that is able to give immediate feedback after analysing user's speech. For now these feedback would be small and obvious things that would be commonly found in weak or inexperienced speakers.
